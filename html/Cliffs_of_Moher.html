			<h1>Cliffs of Moher</h1>
			<p>The Cliffs of Moher are beautiful sea cliffs located on the west coast of County Clare. The cliffs run for 14km from Doolin in the north to Liscannor in the south. I found that the best way to get there is by car. A popular place to park is the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Centre car park. From there you’re free to roam wherever you please, with caution of course by staying behind the barriers. Most people tend to only hike for a short period, but I would really recommend hiking at least half the way. The scenery is extremely gorgeous and filled with bird and plant life.</p> 
			<p>During your hike you might spot some towers. These towers were built with the thought of protecting the country from possible oversea invasions. Mother Tower at Hag’s Head is located on the southern side close to the village of Liscannor. This tower was built in 1808 with the intention of protecting from a potential French invasion. During this time period Ireland was still under British rule. </p>
