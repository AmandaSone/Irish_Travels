			<h1>School system in Ireland</h1>
			<p>The Irish school system is pretty different from what I’m used to in Norway. First of all, kids in Ireland start school a bit earlier then we do in Norway. They usually start around 4 or 5 years old. Back home we start at age 6 (5 if you have a late birthday). School is divided into primary, secondary, and then third level (university or college), similar to Norway’s education system, but the structure within is a bit different.</p>
			<p>One somewhat similar thing they have is the “Transition Year” in secondary school. It’s a year where students take a break from the usual academic pressure to do work experience, try new subjects, or travel. In Norway this can be seen as a gap year or an exchange year. Many students take an exchange year in 2nd vgs, which here in Ireland would be fourth or fifth year of secondary school depending on if you had a transition year or not. </p>
			<p>Many Irish schools still have uniforms, which is pretty rare in Norway. Also, a lot of schools are run by religious organizations, mainly Catholic ones. You’re also required to pay student fees so that sucks. </p>
